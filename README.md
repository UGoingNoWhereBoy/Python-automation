# Create django project without going through the same cmds over and over again with a simple script 

## This runs only on windows
## You need pyautogui to run this script 
## Make sure CapsLock is off so your system wont output Caps
## if you find this project is helpful give it a star <3 
## any bug fixes and changes are welcome
